# World Cup 2022 — Player & Club Analysis
A full data analysis project exploring the FIFA World Cup 2022 squads using SQL Server, Python, and Excel.
This project demonstrates a complete end‑to‑end data pipeline: sourcing, cleaning, transforming, analysing, and visualising real‑world football data.

# Project Focus
The analysis explores:

Player experience (caps)

Age distribution

Goals per game

Club and league representation

Comparison of all players vs the last four teams

Insights into which clubs and leagues were most affected by the tournament

Data Cleaning Summary
Excel Cleaning
•	Removed images and formatting from Wikipedia tables
•	Created structured tables for:
o	Squads
o	Stadiums
o	Groups
o	Football associations
o	Club leagues
o	Clubs
o	Match reports
•	Added a unique Player_No primary key
•	Exported cleaned tables to CSV
Python Cleaning

Analysis Sections
1. Player Experience
Players were categorised based on caps:
•	Newcomer: < 20
•	Novice: 20–39
•	Regular: 40–79
•	Master: 80–100
•	Legend: 101+
Visualisations include:
•	Bar chart of experience categories
•	Scatterplot of age vs caps
•	Distribution curve of caps
•	Boxplot of caps by experience

2. Age Distribution
Players were grouped into age brackets:
•	Under 18
•	18–21
•	22–25
•	26–29
•	30–33
•	34–37
•	38–42
•	Over 42
Visualisations include:
•	Age range bar chart
•	Age distribution curve
•	Oldest player identification

3. Goals Per Game
A performance metric was created:
Goals_Per_Game = Goals / Caps
Only players with 20+ caps were included to avoid skewed ratios.
Output includes:
•	Top 10 players by goals per game
•	Their national teams
•	Their clubs

4. Last Four Teams Comparison
Merged Outcome.csv with the main dataset to analyse:
•	Winner
•	Runner Up
•	Third
•	Fourth
Comparison metrics:
•	Mean caps
•	Median caps
•	Mean age
•	Median age
This highlights differences between the full player pool (830 players) and the elite final four (104 players).

5. Club & League Impact
Grouped by:
•	Current club
•	Football league
•	Football association
Outputs include:
•	Top 20 clubs with the most World Cup players
•	Top 20 leagues
•	Mean, median, and standard deviation of club representation

Conclusion
This project provides a full analytical breakdown of the World Cup 2022 squads, combining:
•	Data engineering
•	Statistical analysis
•	Visualisation
•	Football domain knowledge
It demonstrates a complete end to end workflow suitable for data analytics portfolios, academic submissions, or football analytics enthusiasts.
